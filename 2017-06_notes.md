- deploy to 'production' regularly
    - production being your dev server
    - meaning you should be able to email Elli a url every day of a new feature, or of added functionality

- related to the above, the utility of using a script to update the server code from github
    - the script does a git-pull, and...
    - 'touches' the file that makes the new code active
    - optional: the script can also update permissions on the code

- keep out of git:
    - passwords
    - server-paths
    - db and db-table names
    - strong suggestion: do not count on .gitignore to keep out settings
