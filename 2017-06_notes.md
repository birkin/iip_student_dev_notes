### 2017-07-26-Wednesday

- worked w/J.M. to get solr ports opened

- covered automatic log-rotataion
    - mac: `cd /etc/newsyslog.d/`
    - showed sample format for file:

            $
            $ cat ./project_log.conf

            # idea: <http://randomerrata.com/post/64121939537/newsyslog-d>
            # docs: <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?newsyslog.conf(5)>

            # logfilename                  [owner:group]  mode   count  size(KB)  when  flags [/pid_file] [sig_num]
            /path/to/project_logs/*.log    _www:staff     664    5      250       *     G

            $

- goal: master always works, even if not complete

- showed github [releases](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip_smr_web_project/releases)
    - noted one approach: to make releases reflect versions of working code put into production
    - noted benefit: easy to find working version to revert to if things go south

- troubleshot template-error w/S. -- got the django 1.11 reverse url-lookup syntax working

- got student-update-script working; emailed S. & W. to try it; troubleshot S. problem report w/J.M. -- think we got it working

---


### undated stuff covered over about 3 meetings

- went over updated version of C.R.'s code, [now using python3 & django-1.11](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip_smr_web_project)

- gave them overview of xml & stylesheets

- looked into S.'s report of a problem with bibliographies

### 2017-06-27-Tuesday

- goal: deploy to 'production' regularly
    - production being your dev server
    - meaning you should be able to email E.M., or Prof, a url every day of a new feature, or of added functionality

- related to the above, the utility of using a script to update the server code from github
    - the script does a git-pull, and...
    - 'touches' the file that makes the new code active
    - optional: the script can also update permissions on the code

- keep out of git:
    - passwords
    - server-paths
    - db and db-table names
    - strong suggestion: do not count on .gitignore to keep out settings
